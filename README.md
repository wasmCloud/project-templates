# wasmCloud project templates

This repository contains some project templates that you can use
to quickly get started on a new project.

Try one of the these to start:
- `wash new actor` to create a new actor project, 
- `wash new provider` to start a new capability provider project, or 
- `wash new interface` to start a new interface project.

The wash command has additional online help. Add `--help` to get more
information about any command and its available options.
