# Messaging Capability Provider

This capability provider is an implementation of the `wasmcloud:messaging` contract. It exposes publish, request, and subscribe functionality to actors.

You can see an example implementation of this provider with the [NATS Messaging provider](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers/tree/main/nats).
