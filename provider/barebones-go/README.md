# Barebones Golang Template

This template is meant to be used as a quick start to writing go providers.  
It will compile and run in its default form, but the only evidence you will see that it is working, is the custom health check (that you would have to view on the lattice).

You can view a functioning example of a `httpserver` in the wasmCloud examples [repo](https://github.com/wasmCloud/examples/tree/main/provider/httpserver-go)
